## 🚀 Project Overview: "Next-Gen Inventory Command Center"
This is a high-performance Inventory Management System designed to bridge the gap between complex logistics and premium user experience. It uses a Spring Boot backend and a React (Vite/TypeScript) frontend.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion.
- **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, MySQL, Flyway (Migration).
- **Security**: Spring Security, JWT (Bearer Token), BCrypt, Email OTP.
- **Design Tools**: Stitch (Project ID: `15072817964032502010`).

## 🌌 Design Philosophy: "Neon-Glass Methodology"
We have moved away from traditional spreadsheet-link designs. The system now follows a "Ethereal Command Center" aesthetic.

### 💎 Core Tokens
- **Background**: `surface` #0F131F (Deep Space).
- **Primary**: `primary` #CDBDFF (Luminous Violet).
- **Accents**: `secondary` #BDF4FF (Neon Cyan), `tertiary` #FFABF3 (Neon Magenta).
- **Light Theme Accent Mapping**: darkened accent variants are enforced for readability (`purple` #5B21B6, `blue` #0E7490, `pink` #9D174D, `yellow/warning` #854D0E).
- **Core Aesthetic**: 
  - **Glassmorphism**: Semi-transparent cards (`backdrop-blur: 20px`).
  - **Luminous Depth**: Using glowing box-shadows instead of standard black shadows.
  - **Asymmetry**: Wide spacing and oversized editorial headers.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Key Components

### 🖥️ Frontend (React)
- **Root**: `src/App.tsx` (Provider composition only).
- **Routing Layer**:
  - `src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx`: Central route tree for public, guest, and protected navigation.
  - `src/routes/paths.ts`: Route constants + tab/path mapping (including public landing route).
  - `src/routes/RouteGuards.tsx`: Auth-based guest/protected guards.
- **Layout Layer**:
  - `src/layouts/AppShell.tsx`: Protected app chrome (Header, Outlet, Footer).
  - `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`: Solid top navigation bar for improved readability.
- **Hooks**:
  - `src/hooks/useTheme.ts`: Global theme state + persistence.
- **Design Tokens**:
  - `src/index.css`: Base tokens + light-mode accent overrides for hardcoded Tailwind color utilities.
- **Contexts**:
  - `AuthContext`: Manages JWT sessions, user info, registration OTP flow, and forgot-password OTP reset flow state.
  - `InventoryContext`: Manages products, suppliers, and sales data.
- **Key Pages**:
  - `LandingPage.tsx`: Public marketing landing page with local-friendly copy, feature highlights, and auth CTAs.
  - `Dashboard.tsx`: Overview with key metrics.
  - `ProductManager.tsx`: Full CRUD for products.
  - `SupplierManager.tsx`: Full CRUD for suppliers.
  - `SellProduct.tsx`: Transaction-focused interface.
  - `auth/`: Contains Login, Register, registration OTP verification, Forgot Password, Forgot Password OTP, and Reset Password pages.
  - `components/auth/PasswordFieldWithRules.tsx`: Reusable password field with live rules and eye toggle.

### ⚙️ Backend (Spring Boot)
- **Base Package**: `com.avaks.inventory`
- **Key Modules**:
  - `entity/`: Product, Supplier, User, Otp.
  - `controller/`: REST endpoints for all entities.
  - `service/`: Business logic (OTP generation, sale processing, registration/forgot-password auth workflows).
  - `security/`: JWT filtering and authentication configuration.
  - `config/`: Runtime configuration (security/auth + app wiring), including cache provider setup.
- **Caching Model**:
  - Spring Cache abstraction is enabled with per-user cache keys for products, suppliers, and dashboard profit reads.
  - Cache provider is selectable (`simple` local in-memory by default, `redis` when configured via environment).
  - Write paths (product/supplier CRUD and sales mutations) evict affected cache entries to preserve consistency.
- **Deployment Operations**:
  - Single-node Linux VM deployment assets are located in `deploy/linux-single-node/`.
  - Includes host bootstrap (swap + Docker + Nginx + Certbot), Docker Compose deploy script, systemd unit templates, nginx reverse-proxy template, and deployment runbook.
- **Data Isolation Model**:
  - Inventory entities (`Supplier`, `Product`, `Sale`, `ProfitRecord`, `Order`) are user-owned via `user_id`.
  - Repository/service methods are user-scoped to enforce per-login store isolation.

### 🌐 Domain Topology
- **Frontend (Vercel)**: `godamm.mraks.dev`, `godamm.anjaliv.dev`
- **Backend API (Linux Server + Nginx)**: `api.godamm.mraks.dev`

## 🛠️ System Hardening & Reliability

### 💎 Atomic Inventory Transactions
We use atomic SQL updates for stock management to prevent race conditions during high-volume sales.
- **Atomic Decrement**: `ProductRepository.decrementStock` ensures stock only decreases if sufficient quantity exists, preventing "Double Sell" scenarios.
- **Optimized Profit Tracking**: The system maintains an incremental `ProfitRecord` rather than re-calculating the entire sales history, ensuring O(1) performance for profit reporting.

### 🔐 Tenant Data Safety
- Store data is isolated per authenticated user, preventing cross-account visibility or writes.
- Stock decrements and sales/profit updates are scoped to the owner (`decrementStockForUser`) to keep transactional integrity in multi-user usage.

### 🧪 Startup Data Policy
- Automatic startup demo-data reset is disabled by default.
- Existing user inventory is preserved across restarts unless changed explicitly through APIs.

## 📝 Agent Instructions for Modification
1. **Preserve Context**: Always read `Agents.md` before starting a task.
2. **Sync Updates**: If you add new pages, backend entities, or change the design system, **YOU MUST** update the "Architecture" and "Status" sections of this file immediately.
3. **Aesthetics First**: Never implement a basic UI. Always aim for the "Wowed" factor using the tokens defined here.
4. **Clean Code**: maintain TypeScript types and descriptive variable names.
